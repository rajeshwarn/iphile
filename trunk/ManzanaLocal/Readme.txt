* Welcome to Manzana
====================

Manzana is a simple and powerful .NET library that lets you read/write 
files from/to the iPhone, list directory contents and other file and 
directory related functions. 

Expect the library to be enhanced as more internal details on the iPhone 
are unveiled.
